# ECG-Monitoring-System

Heart disease has become a significant global concern over the past few decades, leading to numerous fatalities.
Early detection and monitoring of heart conditions, such as through ECG signals, can be crucial in preventing
severe outcomes. This project introduces an IoT-based ECG Monitoring System using the AD8232 ECG Sensor and
ESP32. Our system aims to provide continuous, real-time monitoring of ECG signals, enabling early intervention 
and potentially saving lives.

In addtion to uploading the data to the ubidots platform we have also tried of creating machine learning algorithm 
for evaluating the patient data and connecting them to frontend and Backend.
